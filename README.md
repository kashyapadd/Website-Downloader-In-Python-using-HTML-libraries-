#The program receives a URL pointing to a base HTML file as a command line argument, and then downloads this base file as
well as all image objects referenced by that file. There is no need to download videos. You only need
to support nonpersistent connections.

You can use the HTMLParser library to parse the HTML file and identify all images there. More
information about this library can be found at https://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html.
